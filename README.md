   # Introduction

   Sup people,
   after many years (2. Im fucking old now send help.) i decided to make this Guide for Ryujinx too.\
   Had this Idea sitting in my head for some time now, so i thought why not just do it now.\
   Most will look copied and im recording this while im writing this for the ASMR Keyboard People here. (Or if your generally interested on how i work on this lol)\
   This from the Code basis may look like the [Switch Repo](https://github.com/PrincessAkira/road-to-yuzu-without-switch), which indeed it is. Why re-invent the wheel?\

   # Guide

   ## Setup

   Go to the [Rujinx Site](https://ryujinx.org/download) and Download the Build.
